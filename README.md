## üëÅÔ∏è About: 

### üìñ Description

Taprooms have to have a great selection, but they also need to be able to manage their kegs in stock and know when they need to be swapped out.  Using React native, this web app will allow users to input new taps and record when pints are pulled from kegs so they can keep track of sales as well as know when to refill/swap out the kegs.  

#### User Stories

| US02 | As a user I want to submit a form for a new keg | false |
| US03 | As a user I want to be able to click on a keg to see keg details | false |
| US04 | As a user I want to be able to see how many kegs are left | false |
| US05 | As a user I want to be able to click a button to decrease the number of pints by 1 | false |
